========================================================================

Version 1.1 - 24.03.2011:
 Implemented Slowfallability Cloak
 I forced to loot all Mobs killed by the Plugin. So you could uncheck Loot Mobs in GB2.
 Fixed a Typo in Priest Pull Spell
 Log output if he founds a Mob but you have config not to kill him or if you found a dragon while using Ground Moult Mode - Just for your Info ;)

Version 1.2 - 25.03.2011:
 Bugfix with loot BoP

Version 1.3 - 26.03.2011:
 Now the Bot will not attack mobs which are tagged by other players - but he will wait if the other player really kills the mob. If the other player dies or looses the Aggro your Char will tagg and kill the Mob. - Is this ok so? Because maybe it is some kind of ninja
 Blacklist not lootable corpses he founds for 5 minutes so he will not spam the "I found something dead"-message and other messages again and again in HB
 Replaced the Default Pull Behavior for Palas
 Now you could choose more then one Slowfallability. The Bot will try to use the one which is not in Cooldown till he gets a Slowfall Aura.
	First he will try to use the configured Slowfallspell (if you have enabled it)
	Then he will try per default: Slow Fall or Levitate - only if your Char is a Mage or Priest
	Then he trys a equipped Cloak, if you enable it
	Then last but not least he trys the configured Item, if enabled
 Implemented some better querys when saved the Config Window to avoid failed behavior of the Bot.
 Implemented that Rogues and Warrior shoot or throw Vyragosa down.
